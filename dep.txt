Old Solution: This File "openh264-1.8.0-win64.dll" Should be added to the PATH of your system:
https://github.com/cisco/openh264/releases and Choose the correct version
Or you could put the file in the same directory of python script

New Solution: Now the file is included automatically from lib folder by code

FFmpeg should be installed on your machine
